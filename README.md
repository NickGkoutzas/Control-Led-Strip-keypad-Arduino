# Control-Led-Strip-keypad-Arduino
Control your led strip via a (4x3) keypad. Code contains 9 animations...
Arduino - 9 animations , color and brightness control (of each animation) at any time via keypad (4x3) 
[With button '0' ,you can turn off the led strip]
The code is big enough ,because you can change/interrupt any animation you want at any time ,while another animation is running that period.
(You should not have to wait, until an animation stops).
